        <li>Leather and Matte Desk Pads are particularly prone to damage in transit. Please roll to at least a 6-inch diameter, and send in a similarly sized box as it was shipped in. For Matte Desk Pads, roll with the cork side out if you have unrolled it from its original packaging.</li>
        <li>Due to variations in monitor/screen settings and the wide variation in natural material, images on the website may not match the actual products shipped. Color/grain dissatisfaction is not a valid reason for an exchange.</li>
  <li>If you received your item as a gift, please include any information you have - the order number, the name or email of the person who ordered the gift, etc - and we will make sure you are taken care of.</li>
